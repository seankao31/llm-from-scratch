# LLM From Scratch

This was a casual side projectâ€”just following along with the book for fun.\
Iâ€™m not planning to go further for now, but the code is here in case future-me or someone else finds it useful.

## Source

Based on the book:\
**[Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch)** by Sebastian Raschka\
ISBN: 978-1633437166

Up to: **Chapter 6.6 (p. 194)**

## Code Notes

Itâ€™s barely structuredâ€”pretty much a dumping ground for code from several chapters.

The best way to follow my progress is through the commit history.\
Each commit has a runnable `main` that (usually) does something useful.

Or spare yourself and just visit the official repo instead:\
